# OPSource: AI IDE Alignment Framework Implementation

## Overview

OPSource is a comprehensive implementation of the AI IDE Alignment Framework, providing a robust foundation for building intelligent development environments. The project follows strict ethical principles and technical standards to ensure reliable, secure, and user-centric AI-powered development tools.

## Core Components

### 1. anya-core/dash33

AI Decision Engine implementing:

- Memory safety guarantees
- Thread safety
- Formal verification
- Zero-cost abstractions

### 2. anya-core/mobile

Cross-platform UI framework featuring:

- Material Design 3 compliance
- Accessibility standards
- Platform-agnostic patterns
- Hot reload support

### 3. anya-core/enterprise

Business logic implementation with:

- Modular architecture
- Security-first design
- Metrics collection
- Integration patterns

### 4. anya-core/web5-rs

Decentralized infrastructure providing:

- DID implementation
- Verifiable credentials
- Self-sovereign identity
- Decentralized storage

## Technical Standards
