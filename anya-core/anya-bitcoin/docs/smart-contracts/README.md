# Smart Contracts

The Anya Smart Contract module provides a flexible framework for creating,
managing, and executing smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is
designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use.

The module is divided into three main components:

1. **Contract Templates**: A set of pre-defined contract templates for common
use cases, such as payment channels and escrow services. These templates can be
used to create new contracts with minimal code.
2. **Script Types**: A set of pre-defined script types that can be used to
create custom contracts. These script types include support for common
operations, such as arithmetic and cryptographic operations.
3. **Contract Management**: A set of APIs for managing contracts, including
creating, deploying, and executing contracts. The contract management APIs also
include support for event handling and error handling.

The Smart Contract module is designed to be highly customizable and extensible.
Developers can create custom contract templates, script types, and contract
management APIs to support their specific use cases.

The Anya Smart Contract module is built on top of the Bitcoin protocol and is
designed to be compatible with the Bitcoin Core wallet and other Bitcoin
wallets. It is also designed to be compatible with other Anya modules, such as
the Bitcoin Node module and the Bitcoin Wallet module.

The Anya Smart Contract module is currently in development and is not yet
available for use. However, it is expected to be released in the near future.
