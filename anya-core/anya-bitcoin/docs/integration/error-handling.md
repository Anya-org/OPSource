# Error Handling

The error handling system is designed to catch and handle unexpected errors that may arise during the operation of the system. This documentation outlines the error handling system and how it should be used.

## Error Types

The error handling system is designed to handle multiple types of errors. These include:

* **System Errors**: Errors that occur outside of the control of the system, such as network errors or hardware failures.
* **User Errors**: Errors that occur due to user input, such as invalid data or incorrect parameters.
* **Logical Errors**: Errors that occur due to the incorrect implementation of a function or system component.

## Error Handling

The error handling system is designed to handle errors in the following way:

1. **Error Detection**: The system detects an error, either through an exception or through a specific error code.
2. **Error Classification**: The system determines the type of error that has occurred and takes the appropriate action.
3. **Error Reporting**: The system logs the error and alerts the user to the fact that an error has occurred.
4. **Error Recovery**: The system attempts to recover from the error by retrying the operation or performing a rollback.

## Error Codes

The error handling system uses the following error codes to classify and handle errors.

* **001**: System error.
* **002**: User error.
* **003**: Logical error.

## Error Messages

The error handling system uses the following error messages to alert the user to the fact that an error has occurred.

* **001**: "System error. Please contact the system administrator."
* **002**: "User error. Please check your input and try again."
* **003**: "Logical error. Please contact the system administrator."
