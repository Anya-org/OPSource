# Block Processing

## Overview
The Block Processing system is responsible for processing incoming blocks from the Bitcoin network. This includes verifying the block and its transactions, updating the internal state, and storing the block and its transactions in the database.

## Components
The Block Processing system consists of the following components:

### Block Verifier
The Block Verifier is responsible for verifying the validity of an incoming block. This includes checking the block's hash, verifying the transactions, and checking the block's timestamp.

### Transaction Processor
The Transaction Processor is responsible for processing the transactions in the block. This includes verifying the transaction's inputs, checking the transaction's script, and updating the internal state.

### State Updater
The State Updater is responsible for updating the internal state of the system after a block has been verified and its transactions processed. This includes updating the current block height, updating the UTXO set, and updating the coin supply.

### Database Storage
The Database Storage component is responsible for storing the block and its transactions in the database.

## Flow
The flow of the Block Processing system is as follows:

1. The Block Verifier verifies the incoming block.
2. The Transaction Processor processes the transactions in the block.
3. The State Updater updates the internal state of the system.
4. The Database Storage component stores the block and its transactions in the database.

## Error Handling
The Block Processing system handles errors by logging the error and continuing with the next block. If the error is critical, such as a failure to connect to the database, the system will shut down.
