# Network Tests

Documentation for Network Tests

The network tests are a set of tests that are used to verify that the Anya framework is working as expected on different networks. These tests are important for the development of the Anya framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple components of the framework.

## Running Network Tests

The network tests can be run using the following command: [cargo test --test network_tests](https://github.com/anuraghazra/Anya/blob/master/anyacore/tests/network_tests.rs)
