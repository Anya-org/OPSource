Documentation for Testing

## Overview

Testing is a crucial part of the Anya Framework. It is essential to ensure that the code works as expected and that any new code does not break existing functionality. The testing process is important for the development of the Anya Framework, as it helps to identify and fix bugs early on. It is also important for the users of the Anya Framework, as it ensures that the code is reliable and that the users can trust the results.

## Types of Testing

There are several types of testing that are important for the Anya Framework. These include:

*   **Unit Testing**: This is the process of testing individual units of code to ensure that they behave as expected. Unit tests are important for the development of the Anya Framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs early on.

    See [Unit Tests](unit-tests.md) for more information on how to write unit tests.

*   **Integration Testing**: This is the process of testing multiple units of code together to ensure that they interact correctly. Integration tests are important for the development of the Anya Framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple units of code.

    See [Integration Tests](integration-tests.md) for more information on how to write integration tests.

*   **System Testing**: This is the process of testing the entire Anya Framework to ensure that it works as expected. System tests are important for the development of the Anya Framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple components of the framework.

    See [System Tests](system-tests.md) for more information on how to write system tests.

## Running Tests

Running tests is an important part of the testing process. When running tests, it is important to keep the following in mind:

*   **Run Tests Frequently**: Tests should be run frequently to ensure that the code is working as expected. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs early on.
*   **Run All Tests**: All tests should be run to ensure that the code is working as expected. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple units of code.
