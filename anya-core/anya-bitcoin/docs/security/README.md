Documentation for Security

## Overview

Security is a key component of the Anya Bitcoin Platform. We provide a comprehensive set of features to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your data.

### Key Features

* **Encryption**: We use AES-256-GCM encryption for all data at rest and in transit. This ensures that all data is protected from unauthorized access.
* **Access Control**: We provide a robust access control system to ensure that only authorized users can access data. This includes:
	+ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: We provide a robust RBAC system to ensure that only authorized users can access data.
	+ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: We provide MFA to ensure that even if a user's credentials are compromised, their account is still protected.
* **Auditing**: We provide a complete audit trail of all access to data. This ensures that any unauthorized access to data is detected and can be traced.
* **Key Management**: We provide a secure key management system to ensure the integrity of your data. This includes:
	+ **Secure Key Storage**: We store all keys securely using a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
	+ **Regular Key Rotation**: We regularly rotate all keys to ensure that even if a key is compromised, it will only be valid for a short period of time.
	+ **Secure Key Distribution**: We provide a secure key distribution system to ensure that all keys are distributed securely.
