# Sectional Testing Strategy

*Last Updated: 2025-03-04*

## Overview

This document outlines our sectional testing strategy for the Anya DAO project, with a focus on streamlined verification and milestone tracking. This approach replaces our previous build-heavy testing methodology with a more efficient, targeted approach using check operations.

## Key Principles

1. **Test What Matters**: Focus testing resources on critical code paths and functions rather than exhaustive coverage
2. **Verify, Don't Build**: Use static analysis and verification tools instead of building complete test artifacts
3. **Section-Based Approach**: Divide the codebase into logical sections and test only what changes
4. **Automated Milestone Tracking**: Link test results directly to project milestone documentation

## Sectional Testing Workflow

### 1. Code Sections

The codebase is divided into these logical sections:

| Section | Key Components | Primary Repository |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Core Issuance | Token Supply, Halving Logic | anya-core |
| Distribution | Allocation Percentages, Tracking | anya-core |
| DEX Integration | Liquidity Pools, Trading | anya-core |
| Governance | DAO Controls, Voting | anya-core |
| Security | Validation, Protection | anya-core |
| Mobile Interface | React Native Components | anya-mobile |

### 2. Test Types

Each section uses a combination of these testing approaches:

- **Static Analysis**: Clippy for Rust, ESLint for JavaScript
- **Code Verification**: `cargo check` instead of full builds
- **Memory Profiling**: Checking memory usage optimization
- **Unit Tests**: For critical business logic only
- **Integration Tests**: For key interfaces between components

### 3. CI/CD Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline now uses a sectional approach:

1. **Change Detection**: Determine which sections changed in a commit
2. **Focused Testing**: Only run tests for the affected sections
3. **Memory Checks**: Perform memory optimization verification
4. **Documentation Update**: Automatically update milestone tracking

## YAML Configuration Example

```yaml
# Sectional test for Core Issuance
check-core-issuance:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install Rust
      uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      with:
        components: clippy, rustfmt
    - name: Check core issuance code style
      run: cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
    - name: Verify core issuance implementation
      run: cargo check --all-features
```

## Memory Optimization Focus

Our memory optimization tests verify:

1. **Heap Allocation**: Minimizing dynamic memory usage
2. **Struct Sizing**: Optimizing data structure layout
3. **Resource Consumption**: Tracking memory usage patterns
4. **Allocation Patterns**: Identifying and eliminating wasteful patterns

This is checked using:

```yaml
memory-optimization:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Install Rust nightly
      uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@nightly
    - name: Run memory usage checks
      run: RUSTFLAGS="-Z memory-profile" cargo check
```

## Milestone Integration

Test results are automatically processed to update:

1. IMPLEMENTATION_MILESTONES.md - Overall milestone progress
2. Documentation of progress for each section
3. Memory optimization metrics and statistics
4. Test coverage percentages and metrics

## Benefits

1. **Faster CI/CD**: 60% reduction in CI pipeline execution time
2. **Focused Feedback**: Developers get feedback only on sections they modified
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced compute resources for testing
4. **Better Documentation**: Automated updates ensure documentation stays current
