This document outlines the architecture and organization of the Anya DAO system within the Anya Core project, following the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 standards.

## System Map

### Directory Structure

│   │   └── dao-core.clar        # Enhanced Core DAO implementation
│   ├── traits/

    └── contracts/
        ├── dao.clar             # Main DAO contract with full governance
        └── governance_token.clar # Governance token contract
```

### System Components

1. **DAO Trait (`dao/traits/dao-trait.clar`)**
   - Defines the interface for DAO functionality
   - Provides contract interoperability standards
   - Ensures implementation consistency

2. **Enhanced DAO Core (`dao/core/dao-core.clar`)**
   - Implements the DAO trait with comprehensive functionality
   - Four major enhancement areas:
     - **Token Integration**: Full integration with SIP-010 fungible tokens
     - **Enhanced Proposal Validation**: Comprehensive validation for proposals
     - **Administrative Functions**: Advanced admin controls and settings
     - **Logging System**: Comprehensive event logging for transparency
   - Manages proposals, settings, and admin privileges

3. **Main DAO Contract (`src/contracts/dao.clar`)**
   - Integrates with DAO Core using the trait
   - Implements advanced governance features:
     - Voting mechanisms
     - Proposal execution
     - Timelock functionality
   - Interacts with governance token

4. **Governance Token (`src/contracts/governance_token.clar`)**
   - SIP-010 compliant fungible token
   - Used for voting weight in governance
   - Required for proposal submission
   - Integrates with DAO Core for token minting

5. **Test Script (`dao/tests/dao-core-test.clar`)**
   - Comprehensive test suite for DAO Core
   - Tests all major features:
     - Admin management
     - DAO settings management
     - Proposal creation and validation
     - Logging functionality
     - Token integration

## Enhanced DAO Core Features

### 1. Token Integration

The enhanced DAO Core now provides full integration with SIP-010 compliant token contracts:

- **Token Contract Reference**: Configurable reference to the governance token
- **Mint Function**: Properly integrates with the token contract's mint function
- **Balance Checking**: Verifies token balances for proposal validation
- **Admin Functions**: Ability to update the token contract reference

### 2. Enhanced Proposal Validation

Comprehensive proposal validation ensures the integrity of the governance process:

- **Duration Checks**: Validates proposal durations against min/max thresholds
- **Token Threshold**: Requires minimum token balance for proposers
- **Content Validation**: Ensures proposal content meets requirements
- **Status Management**: Properly tracks and updates proposal status

### 3. Administrative Functions

Advanced administrative capabilities for managing the DAO:

- **Multi-Admin Support**: Delegation of administrative privileges to multiple accounts
- **DAO Settings Management**: Ability to update name, description, and governance parameters
- **Threshold Configuration**: Configurable thresholds for proposals and quorums
- **Voting Period Management**: Adjustable voting periods and execution delays

### 4. Comprehensive Logging System

Transparent logging of all significant actions:

- **Structured Logs**: Each log entry includes type, timestamp, actor, and details
- **Log Types**: Different log types for various actions (admin, proposal, token)
- **Log Retrieval**: Functions to retrieve logs with pagination
- **Historical Record**: Maintains a permanent on-chain history of all actions

## Integration Points

### Clarinet Configuration

The system is defined in `Clarinet.toml` with the following contract definitions:

```toml
[contracts]
governance-token = {path = "src/contracts/governance_token.clar"}
dao = {path = "src/contracts/dao.clar"}
dao-trait = {path = "dao/traits/dao-trait.clar"}
dao-core = {path = "dao/core/dao-core.clar"}
```

### Contract Dependencies

- **dao.clar** imports both the SIP-010 trait and the DAO trait
- **dao-core.clar** implements the DAO trait and uses the SIP-010 trait
- **governance_token.clar** implements the SIP-010 trait

## Functional Flow

1. Users interact with the main DAO contract
2. The DAO contract uses the governance token for voting weight
3. Core DAO functionality is delegated to dao-core.clar
4. All implementations conform to the dao-trait interface
5. Administrative actions are properly logged for transparency
6. Token operations are performed through the governance token contract

## Bitcoin Development Framework Compliance

The Anya DAO system complies with the following Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 requirements:

1. **Protocol Adherence**
   - Uses Clarity's trait system for interface consistency
   - Maintains decentralized governance principles
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

2. **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**
   - Vote delegation through proxy patterns
   - Private proposal submission options
   - Secure admin controls with proper authorization checks

3. **Asset Management Standards**
   - Governance token uses SIP-010 standard
   - Proper token integration with mint functions
   - Token balance validation for proposal submission

4. **Security Measures**
   - Admin-only access for sensitive operations
   - Multi-level validation for all operations
   - Comprehensive logging for auditing
   - Clear separation of responsibilities between components

## Extensions and Future Development

- **DLC Oracle Integration**: Plans for DLC-based voting using oracle attestations
- **Cross-Chain Governance**: Integration with RSK and Liquid networks
- **Web5 Identity**: Use of decentralized identities for member registration
- **Enhanced Voting Mechanisms**: Quadratic voting and delegation options
- **Advanced Proposal Execution**: Automatic execution of approved proposals

## Development Guidelines

When extending or modifying the DAO system:

1. All new components should implement or use the appropriate traits
2. Maintain the file structure with traits in `dao/traits` and implementations in `dao/core`
3. Update this system map document when making structural changes
4. Follow the standards defined in the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5
5. Add appropriate tests in the test directory for new functionality
6. Ensure all operations are properly logged for transparency
7. Maintain compatibility with existing components and workflows
