# System Integration Architecture Documentation

This document outlines the architecture for system integration, focusing on core integration points, integration patterns, and error handling mechanisms.

## Core Integration Points

### ML System Integration
- **Data Pipeline Integration**: Describes how data flows through various stages from collection to processing.
- **Model Registry Integration**: Details the management and versioning of machine learning models.
- **Metrics Collection Integration**: Explains the collection and aggregation of performance metrics.
- **Validation System Integration**: Covers the validation processes to ensure data and model integrity.

### Blockchain Integration
- **Bitcoin Core Connection**: Integration with the Bitcoin Core for blockchain operations.
- **Lightning Network Interface**: Interface for handling transactions on the Lightning Network.
- **DLC Protocol Support**: Support for Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) for smart contracts.
- **RGB Asset Management**: Management of assets using the RGB protocol.
- **Stacks Smart Contracts**: Integration with Stacks blockchain for smart contract execution.

### Web5 Integration
- **DID Management**: Handling Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for identity management.
- **Data Storage**: Mechanisms for storing data in a decentralized manner.
- **Protocol Handling**: Managing various protocols for data exchange.
- **State Management**: Maintaining the state of the system across different components.

## Integration Patterns
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Validation**: Ensuring data integrity and correctness.
3. **Processing**: Transforming and analyzing data.
4. **Storage**: Storing data in databases or other storage systems.
5. **Analysis**: Analyzing stored data to derive insights.

## Control Flow
1. **Request Handling**: Managing incoming requests.
2. **Authentication**: Verifying user identities.
3. **Authorization**: Granting access based on permissions.
4. **Execution**: Performing the requested operations.
5. **Response**: Sending back the results of the operations.

## Error Handling
1. **Error Detection**: Identifying errors in the system.
2. **Error Classification**: Categorizing errors based on severity and type.
3. **Error Recovery**: Implementing mechanisms to recover from errors.
4. **Error Reporting**: Logging and reporting errors for further analysis.
5. **Error Analysis**: Analyzing errors to prevent future occurrences.
