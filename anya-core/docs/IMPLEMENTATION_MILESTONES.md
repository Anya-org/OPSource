## Next Steps and Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on completing **Milestone 2: Distribution Allocation**, specifically:

1. Finalizing the team member allocation configuration system
2. Implementing distribution tracking and reporting mechanisms
3. Testing the distribution between DEX, team, and DAO allocations
4. Documenting the allocation API for integration with other system components

Work on **Milestone 3: DEX Integration** will begin once Milestone 2 is completed, with an estimated start date in mid-Q2 2025.
