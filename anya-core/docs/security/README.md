# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security architecture, practices, and guidelines for the Anya platform.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management
- API key authentication for services

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission management
- Resource-level access control
- Scope-based authorization

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- At-rest encryption
- Data masking
- Secure key management

### Network Security
- TLS 1.3 enforcement
- Certificate management
- Network segmentation
- DDoS protection

## Security Practices

### Password Management
- Argon2id for password hashing
- Password complexity requirements
- Password rotation policies
- Secure password reset flow

### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- CORS policies
- API versioning

### Audit & Logging
- Security event logging
- Audit trails
- Log retention policies
- Log encryption

### Secure Development
- Secure coding guidelines
- Code review requirements
- Dependency management
- Security testing

## Security Controls

### Access Controls
```yaml
minimum_password_length: 12
password_complexity:
  - uppercase
  - lowercase
  - numbers
  - special_characters
mfa_required: true
session_timeout: 3600  # 1 hour
```

### Rate Limiting
```yaml
api_rate_limits:
  authenticated:
    requests_per_minute: 100
    burst: 20
  unauthenticated:
    requests_per_minute: 20
    burst: 5
```

### Security Headers
```yaml
security_headers:
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  X-XSS-Protection: "1; mode=block"
  Content-Security-Policy: "default-src 'self'"
  Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
```
