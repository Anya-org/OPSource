## Development Process

We have implemented a sectional testing approach that focuses on checking code quality and functionality rather than building full test suites for each component. This approach:

1. Reduces time spent on CI/CD processes
2. Provides faster feedback on code changes
3. Focuses testing resources on critical path components
4. Automatically updates milestone tracking

### Bitcoin Development Framework Compliance

All components are required to meet specific compliance standards:

| Requirement | Implementation | Verification Method |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Protocol Adherence | Core Bitcoin specifications | Automated checks + Manual review |
| Privacy Architecture | Privacy-by-design patterns | Static analysis tools |
| Asset Management | Taproot-enabled standards | Integration tests |
| Memory Optimization | Resource-efficient patterns | Memory profiling |

### Testing Methodology

Our new testing methodology focuses on verification rather than exhaustive testing:

1. **Check Operations**: Use cargo check, clippy, and other static analysis tools
2. **Sectional Testing**: Test specific sections of code based on changes
3. **Memory Profiling**: Check memory usage without running intensive tests
4. **Automated Documentation**: Update milestone tracking based on test results

## Looking Ahead

### Q3-Q4 2024

1. Complete the Rust migration for all core components
2. Finalize the React Native mobile implementation
3. Launch comprehensive DeFi capabilities
4. Implement advanced privacy features

### Q1-Q2 2025

1. Launch full cross-chain interoperability
2. Deploy enterprise-grade security features
3. Release quantum-resistant cryptography options
4. Achieve performance parity across all platforms
