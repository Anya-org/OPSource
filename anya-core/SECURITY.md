## Security Principles

### 1. Cryptographic Integrity

- All cryptographic implementations must adhere to Bitcoin Core security standards
- Use only well-vetted, open-source cryptographic libraries
- Implement constant-time comparison algorithms
- Regular cryptographic algorithm reviews

### 2. Vulnerability Management

#### Reporting Process

1. **Confidential Disclosure**
   - Email: `security@anya-project.org`
   - PGP Key: [Available in `/security/pgp-key.asc`]
   - Encrypted communication mandatory

2. **Vulnerability Classification**
   - **Critical**: Immediate potential for fund loss or network compromise
   - **High**: Significant security risk
   - **Medium**: Potential exploitation pathway
   - **Low**: Minor security concerns

3. **Response Timeline**
   - Initial Acknowledgement: Within 24 hours
   - Preliminary Assessment: Within 48 hours
   - Mitigation Plan: Within 7 days
   - Public Disclosure: Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) principles

### 3. Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

#### For Security Researchers

- Always act in good faith
- Do not exploit discovered vulnerabilities
- Provide detailed, reproducible proof-of-concept
- Allow reasonable time for mitigation before public disclosure

#### For Project Maintainers

- Transparent communication
- No retaliation against good-faith researchers
- Clear, documented remediation process
- Public acknowledgement of contributions

### 4. Threat Model Considerations

#### Attack Vectors

- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Side-channel attacks
- Economic incentive manipulation
- Network-level attacks
- Implementation vulnerabilities

### 5. Compliance and Auditing

- Annual comprehensive security audit
- Continuous integration security scanning
- Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- Third-party penetration testing
