# Security Policy for Anya Project

## Supported Versions

| Version | Security Support | Vulnerability Response |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |

## Security Principles

### 1. Cryptographic Integrity

- All cryptographic implementations must adhere to Bitcoin Core security standards
- Use only well-vetted, open-source cryptographic libraries
- Implement constant-time comparison algorithms
- Regular cryptographic algorithm reviews

### 2. Vulnerability Management

#### Reporting Process

1. **Confidential Disclosure**
   - Email: `security@anya-project.org`
   - PGP Key: [Available in `/security/pgp-key.asc`]
   - Encrypted communication mandatory

2. **Vulnerability Classification**
   - **Critical**: Immediate potential for fund loss or network compromise
   - **High**: Significant security risk
   - **Medium**: Potential exploitation pathway
   - **Low**: Minor security concerns

3. **Response Timeline**
   - Initial Acknowledgement: Within 24 hours
   - Preliminary Assessment: Within 48 hours
   - Mitigation Plan: Within 7 days
   - Public Disclosure: Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) principles

### 3. Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

#### For Security Researchers

- Always act in good faith
- Do not exploit discovered vulnerabilities
- Provide detailed, reproducible proof-of-concept
- Allow reasonable time for mitigation before public disclosure

#### For Project Maintainers

- Transparent communication
- No retaliation against good-faith researchers
- Clear, documented remediation process
- Public acknowledgement of contributions

### 4. Threat Model Considerations

#### Attack Vectors

- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Side-channel attacks
- Economic incentive manipulation
- Network-level attacks
- Implementation vulnerabilities

### 5. RGB Asset Security

#### RGB Asset Transfer with Metadata

- All RGB asset transfers must use secure cryptographic commitment schemes
- Metadata must be encrypted when containing sensitive information
- Private keys for RGB assets must be stored securely using hardware security modules when possible
- Metadata size must be limited to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Batch transfers must validate each recipient independently
- Transfer validation must occur before acceptance of assets

#### Asset Verification

- Asset verification must validate both the asset itself and the transfer history
- Verification must include cryptographic checks of schema compliance
- Double-spend protection must be enforced for all RGB assets
- Metadata integrity must be verified independently of transfer validity

### 6. Wallet Security

#### Multi-Output PSBT

- All PSBTs must be validated for correctness before signing
- Hardware wallet interfaces must sanitize inputs to prevent attacks
- Support for multiple hardware wallet vendors must ensure proper key isolation
- PSBT serialization and deserialization must be robust against malformed inputs
- Fee estimation must have bounds to prevent economic attacks

#### PSBT Signing

- Signing operations must implement constant-time algorithms
- Key storage must adhere to best practices for cold and hot storage
- Transaction visualization must be available before signing
- Hardware wallet communication must be encrypted where possible

### 7. Web5 Security Considerations

#### DWN with Bitcoin Anchoring

- Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN) security relies on cryptographic verification of Bitcoin transaction confirmations
- All DWN message anchoring must be verified against Bitcoin blockchain before being considered immutable
- DWN node authenticity must be verified using DID-based authentication
- Encrypted data stored in DWNs must implement forward secrecy
- Message anchoring must be verified against a minimum of 3 confirmations for production environments
- Key management for DWN message signing follows hardware security module (HSM) best practices

#### DID Resolution Caching

- Cached DID documents must have appropriate time-to-live (TTL) settings
- Cache invalidation must occur on DID update events
- Cache poisoning protection must be implemented
- Signature verification must occur even for cached DID documents
- Cache must be secured against enumeration attacks

#### Verifiable Credentials

- All credential issuance and verification follows W3C standards
- Bitcoin-anchored credentials require transaction confirmation verification
- Credential revocation status must be checked against Bitcoin blockchain and cached with time-based expiry
- Privacy considerations include zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure
- Credential schemas must be versioned and backward compatible

### 8. Compliance and Auditing

- Annual comprehensive security audit
- Continuous integration security scanning
- Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- Third-party penetration testing
- Web5 DWN storage auditing for compliance with data protection regulations
- RGB asset implementation auditing for correctness and security
