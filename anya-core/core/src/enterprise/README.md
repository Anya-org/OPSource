# Enterprise Component

The Enterprise component provides advanced business operations with comprehensive risk management and compliance tracking.

## Architecture

### Repository Layer (`repository.rs`)

- CRUD operations for enterprise operations
- Status tracking
- Compliance monitoring
- Audit trail management
- Risk assessment

### Service Layer (`service.rs`)

- Operation processing
- Business logic
- Security integration
- Compliance checks
- Metrics collection

### Handler Layer (`handler.rs`)

- Request/response processing
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Security enforcement
- Metrics tracking

## Features

### Operation Types

- Atomic Swaps
- Liquid Transfers
- DLC Contracts
- State Chain Transfers
- Multi-party Computation
- Portfolio Rebalancing

### Risk Management

- Risk assessment
- Exposure limits
- Compliance checks
- Approval workflows
- Policy enforcement

### Compliance & Audit

- Transaction monitoring
- Audit trail
- Reporting
- Policy enforcement
- Regulatory compliance

## Usage

```rust
// Example: Initiate atomic swap
let request = EnterpriseOperationRequest {
    operation: OperationRequest::AtomicSwap(AtomicSwapRequest {
        asset_pair: ("BTC", "L-BTC"),
        amounts: (100000000, 100000000),
        counterparty: "party-1",
        timeout_blocks: 144,
        swap_conditions: conditions,
    }),
    organization: org_context,
    execution_parameters: params,
};

let response = enterprise_service.process(&context, request).await?;
```

## Configuration

```toml
[enterprise]
max_transaction_value = 1000000000
daily_limit = 10000000000
approval_timeout_seconds = 3600
risk_threshold = 0.7
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
cargo test --package anya-core --lib enterprise

# Run integration tests
cargo test --package anya-core --test enterprise_integration
```

## Metrics

The component exports the following metrics:

- `enterprise_operation_time`: Histogram of operation execution times
- `enterprise_risk_scores`: Histogram of risk scores
- `enterprise_errors`: Counter of operation errors
- `enterprise_approvals`: Counter of required approvals

## Health Checks

Health monitoring includes:

- Service availability
- Operation performance
- Risk levels
- Compliance status
- Error rates

## Security

Security measures include:

- Input validation
- Access control
- Risk limits
- Audit logging
- Compliance checks

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.34", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
tracing = { version = "0.1", features = ["attributes"] }
metrics = "0.21"
uuid = { version = "1.6", features = ["v4"] }
```
