# Vulnerability Management

Documentation for Vulnerability Management

## Overview

Vulnerability Management is the process of identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities in an application or system. In the context of Anya Core, vulnerability management involves regularly monitoring the project's dependencies and codebase for potential security vulnerabilities, and taking steps to address any vulnerabilities that are identified.

## Process

The following steps are taken to manage vulnerabilities:

1. **Dependency Monitoring**: Anya Core regularly monitors its dependencies for potential security vulnerabilities. This is done by subscribing to the relevant security feeds and monitoring the dependencies for any reported vulnerabilities.
2. **Vulnerability Identification**: Anya Core regularly runs security scans to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase. This includes static code analysis and dynamic code analysis to identify potential issues.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Anya Core assesses the potential impact of any identified vulnerabilities. This includes identifying the severity of the vulnerability, the potential impact of an exploit, and the feasibility of an attack.
4. **Vulnerability Prioritization**: Anya Core prioritizes identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact. The highest priority is given to critical vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to users.
5. **Vulnerability Remediation**: Anya Core takes steps to address identified vulnerabilities. This may involve updating dependencies, patching the codebase, or implementing security controls to mitigate the risk of an exploit.
6. **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Anya Core discloses identified vulnerabilities to the public. This includes providing information on the vulnerability, the potential impact, and any steps that users can take to mitigate the risk of an exploit.

## Tools Used

The following tools are used to manage vulnerabilities in Anya Core:

* [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) - a platform for identifying and managing vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) - a platform for static code analysis.
* [SAST](https://owasp.org/www-project-source-code-analysis-tools/) - a code analysis tool for identifying security vulnerabilities.
* [DAST](https://owasp.org/www-project-dynamic-application-security-testing) - a web application security scanner for identifying security vulnerabilities.
