# Dependency Auditing

Dependency auditing is the process of evaluating the security of a given software's dependencies. This is critical for ensuring that a project is secure, as vulnerabilities in dependencies can be exploited to gain access to the project's components. This process involves checking for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, which can be done using tools such as [cargo audit](https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit) and [cargo deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny).

## Why is Dependency Auditing Important?

Dependency auditing is important because it helps to ensure that a project is secure. When a project uses a dependency that has a known vulnerability, it makes it easier for an attacker to exploit that vulnerability. This is particularly important for projects that deal with sensitive information, such as financial data or personal information.

## How to Conduct Dependency Auditing

Dependency auditing can be conducted in several ways. The most common approach is to use a tool such as [cargo audit](https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit) or [cargo deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. This can be done using the following steps:

1. Install the tool using cargo by running `cargo install cargo-audit` or `cargo install cargo-deny`.
2. Run the tool by running `cargo audit` or `cargo deny` in the root of the project directory.
3. Review the output to identify any known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
4. Update the dependency to the latest version to fix the vulnerability.

## Best Practices for Dependency Auditing

Dependency auditing should be done regularly to ensure that a project is secure. This can be done by:

* Running dependency auditing tools regularly to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Ensuring that dependencies are kept up to date, so that any security patches are applied.
* Using a [Dependency Management](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) tool to manage dependencies and ensure that they are kept up to date.
