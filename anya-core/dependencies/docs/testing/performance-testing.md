# Performance Testing

Documentation for Performance Testing

Performance testing is a type of testing that is used to evaluate the performance of a system. Performance testing is used to measure the performance of a system by simulating a large number of users interacting with the system at the same time.

Performance testing is important because it helps identify bottlenecks in a system and can help identify areas that need improvement. Performance testing can also be used to determine the scalability of a system, which is important when the system is expected to handle a large number of users.

Performance testing can be done in various ways, including:

* Load testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of a system by simulating a large number of users interacting with the system at the same time.
* Stress testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of a system by simulating a large number of users interacting with the system at the same time, with the goal of causing the system to fail.
* Scalability testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of a system by simulating a large number of users interacting with the system at the same time, with the goal of determining the scalability of the system.

Performance testing can be done using various tools, such as:

* JMeter: This is an open source tool that can be used to perform load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing.
* Gatling: This is a commercial tool that can be used to perform load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing.
* NeoLoad: This is a commercial tool that can be used to perform load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing.

Performance testing can be done in various stages, such as:

* Unit testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of individual units of code.
* Integration testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of groups of units of code.
* System testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of the entire system.
* Acceptance testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the performance of the entire system, with the goal of determining if it meets the user's requirements.

Performance testing can be done in various environments, such as:

* Local environment: This is the environment that is used for development and testing.
* Staging environment: This is the environment that is used to test the system before it is deployed to the production environment.
* Production environment: This is the environment that is used to deploy the system to end users.

Performance testing can be done using various types of data, such as:

* Real data: This is data that is collected from end users.
* Synthetic data: This is data that is generated by a computer program.
* Mock data: This is data that is used to simulate real data, but is not actually collected from end users.
