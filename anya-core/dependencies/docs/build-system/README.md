# Build System

The build system is a critical component of the Anya project. It is responsible for building and testing the entire project, including the core system, enterprise features, and all dependencies.

The build system is designed to be highly configurable and extensible. It uses a combination of Cargo and custom build scripts to build the project.

## Overview

The build system is organized into the following components:

* `build.rs`: This is the main build script that is responsible for building the entire project.
* `scripts/`: This directory contains additional build scripts that are used by the build system.
* `build/`: This directory contains the build configuration files, such as `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.

## How it Works

The build system works as follows:

1. The `build.rs` script is executed by Cargo when the project is built.
2. The `build.rs` script calls the `build_all` function, which is responsible for building the entire project.
3. The `build_all` function builds each of the components of the project, including the core system, enterprise features, and all dependencies.
4. The `build_all` function also runs the tests for each component.
5. The `build_all` function outputs the build artifacts, such as the executable and the documentation.

## Customization

The build system can be customized by modifying the build configuration files, such as `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.

The build system can also be customized by modifying the build scripts, such as `build.rs` and the scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

## Extensibility

The build system is designed to be extensible. New components can be added to the project by creating a new directory in the `components/` directory and adding a `build.rs` script to that directory.

The `build.rs` script should call the `build_all` function to build the component.

The `build_all` function will automatically build the component and run its tests.

## Additional Resources

Additional resources for the build system can be found in the following locations:

* The `build/` directory contains the build configuration files, such as `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.
* The `scripts/` directory contains additional build scripts that are used by the build system.
* The `components/` directory contains the components of the project, such as the core system and enterprise features.
