# Toolchain

The Anya Platform uses a variety of tools to build, test, and maintain itself. This
section documents the toolchain and how it is used.

## Toolchain Components

### Cargo

The Anya Platform uses Cargo for package management. Cargo is the package manager
for Rust, the programming language used to implement the Anya Platform. Cargo is
responsible for managing the dependencies required to build the Anya Platform, and
provides a convenient way to run tests, benchmarks, and other development tasks.

### Rustc

The Anya Platform is built using Rust, a systems programming language. Rustc is the
Rust compiler, and is responsible for compiling the Anya Platform source code into
machine code that can be executed by the CPU. Rustc is also used to build the
Anya Platform's dependencies, which are shared libraries that are used to implement
the platform's functionality.

### Clippy

Clippy is a tool for linting Rust source code. Clippy is used to check the Anya
Platform source code for errors and warnings, and to enforce the platform's coding
standards. Clippy is also used to check the platform's dependencies for errors and
warnings.

### Rustfmt

Rustfmt is a tool for formatting Rust source code. Rustfmt is used to enforce the
platform's coding standards, and to ensure that the platform's source code is
consistent and easy to read.

### Git

Git is a version control system used to manage the Anya Platform's source code.
Git is used to track changes to the platform's source code, and to collaborate with
other developers on the platform's development.
