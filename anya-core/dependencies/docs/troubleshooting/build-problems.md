# Build Problems

Common issues and solutions for build problems with the Anya Bitcoin Platform.

## Outdated dependencies

If you are getting errors related to outdated dependencies, try updating your dependencies by running `cargo update` in the root of your project. If you are using a specific version of a dependency, you can try updating to the latest version by running `cargo install --force <dependency-name>`.

## Missing dependencies

If you are getting errors about missing dependencies, make sure you have all the dependencies listed in the `Cargo.toml` file installed. You can check if a dependency is installed by running `cargo tree | grep <dependency-name>`. If a dependency is not installed, you can install it by running `cargo install <dependency-name>`.

## Outdated Rust version

If you are getting errors related to an outdated Rust version, make sure you are using the latest version of Rust. You can check your Rust version by running `rustc --version` and update to the latest version by running `rustup update`.

## Other issues

If none of the above solutions work, try cleaning your project by running `cargo clean` and then try building your project again. If you are still having issues, you can try deleting your `Cargo.lock` file and running `cargo build` again.
