# Web5 Integration Guide

## Overview
Anya integrates with Web5 for decentralized data management and identity.

### Components
1. Data Management
   - **Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)**: a decentralized network of nodes that store and manage data.
   - **Protocol Definitions**: a set of protocols that define how data is stored, queried, and updated.
   - **Schema Validation**: a validation layer that ensures data conforms to a predefined schema.

2. Identity Management
   - **DID Creation and Resolution**: a system for creating and resolving decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for users and organizations.
   - **Key Management**: a system for managing public and private keys associated with DIDs.
   - **Authentication**: a system for authenticating users and organizations using their DIDs.

### Usage Examples
- Creating a DWN for storing user data.
- Resolving a DID to retrieve user data.
- Authenticating a user using their DID.
