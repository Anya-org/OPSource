- Token-based access control
- Session management

### Business Logic

#### Workflow Management
- Custom workflow creation
- Process automation
- Task scheduling

#### Business Rules Engine
- Rule definition and execution
- Decision automation
- Policy enforcement

### Integration Capabilities

#### External Systems
- API gateway integration
- Legacy system connectivity
- Third-party service integration

#### Data Exchange
- ETL processes
- Data transformation
- Format conversion

### Analytics & Reporting

### Key Interfaces

#### Authentication
```rust
pub trait AuthenticationService {
    fn authenticate_user(credentials: Credentials) -> Result<Session, AuthError>;
    fn validate_session(session: Session) -> Result<bool, AuthError>;
    fn revoke_session(session: Session) -> Result<(), AuthError>;
}
```

#### Workflow
```rust
pub trait WorkflowEngine {
    fn create_workflow(definition: WorkflowDef) -> Result<Workflow, WorkflowError>;
    fn execute_workflow(workflow: Workflow) -> Result<WorkflowStatus, WorkflowError>;
    fn monitor_workflow(workflow_id: WorkflowId) -> Result<WorkflowMetrics, WorkflowError>;
}
```

## Integration Guide

### Setting Up Enterprise Features

1. Initialize the enterprise system:
```rust
let enterprise = Enterprise::new(config)?;
enterprise.initialize().await?;
```

2. Configure authentication:
```rust
let auth = AuthenticationService::new()?;
auth.configure(AuthConfig {
    mfa_enabled: true,
    session_timeout: Duration::from_hours(8),
    max_attempts: 3,
})?;
```

3. Set up workflows:
```rust
let workflow_engine = WorkflowEngine::new()?;
workflow_engine.load_definitions("workflows/")?;
workflow_engine.start()?;
```

### Best Practices

1. Security
   - Implement all security measures
   - Regular security audits
   - Access control reviews

2. Performance
   - Optimize database queries
   - Cache frequently used data
   - Monitor system resources

3. Maintenance
   - Regular backups
   - System updates
   - Performance monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
```toml
[enterprise]
environment = "production"
log_level = "info"
max_connections = 100

[auth]
mfa_enabled = true
session_timeout = "8h"
max_attempts = 3

[workflow]
engine = "native"
max_concurrent = 50
timeout = "1h"
```

### Logging Configuration
```toml
[logging]
level = "info"
format = "json"
output = "file"
file_path = "/var/log/enterprise.log"
```

## Deployment

### Requirements
- Database server
- Message queue
- Cache server
- Storage system

### Installation Steps
1. Set up infrastructure
2. Configure environment
3. Deploy services
4. Verify installation
5. Monitor system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
