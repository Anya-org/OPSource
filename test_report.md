## System Status

The system has successfully implemented a Bitcoin-style tokenomics model with:
- Total supply of 21 billion tokens
- Halving interval of 210,000 blocks
- Initial block reward of 5,000 tokens
- Allocation percentages: 30% DEX, 15% team, 55% DAO/community

All core functionality is operational and ready for integration with other components.

## Compliance

The implementation adheres to Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5:
- ✅ Protocol Adherence: Bitcoin-like monetary policy with halving
- ✅ Asset Management Standards: SIP-010 compliance implemented
- ✅ Hexagonal Architecture: Implementation follows required structure
- ⏳ Privacy-Preserving Architecture: In progress
- ⏳ Security Validation: Audit scheduled for Q3 2025
- ⏳ Testing Protocol: Unit tests in development

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining items in Milestone 2:
   - Implement team member individual allocation configuration
   - Finalize distribution tracking and reporting system

2. Begin preparation for Milestone 3 (DEX Integration)
   - Set up DEX adapter contract structure
   - Define liquidity pool initialization parameters
   - Create integration tests with mock DEX

3. Schedule mid-Q2 review for Milestone 2 completion
