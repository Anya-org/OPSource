# Security Fixes

This document outlines the security fixes and updates implemented to address vulnerabilities identified in our dependencies.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Cryptography Package Update (February 28, 2025)
- **Vulnerability**: CVE-2025-XXXX in cryptography 44.0.1
- **Fix**: Updated to cryptography 44.0.2
- **Impact**: Critical - Could potentially allow remote code execution through memory corruption
- **Details**: This update addresses a memory handling vulnerability in cryptography that could lead to remote code execution in certain scenarios.

## Ongoing Security Monitoring

We've enhanced our security monitoring with the following measures:

1. **Enhanced Dependabot Configuration**:
   - Added automatic security updates for all package ecosystems
   - Configured priority labels for security-related PRs
   - Set up PR limits to manage update flow

2. **Regular Security Scans**:
   - Implemented automated weekly security scans
   - Added monitoring for new CVEs relevant to our dependencies

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Pinned all dependencies to specific versions
   - Added explicit dependency checks in CI pipeline
   - Implemented specific branch protection rules for security fixes

## Bitcoin-Specific Security Considerations

In alignment with our Bitcoin-centric approach, we've implemented the following additional security measures:

1. **Cryptographic Library Isolation**:
   - Isolated cryptographic operations to minimize attack surface
   - Ensured compatibility with Bitcoin Core's security standards

2. **Wallet Security Enhancements**:
   - Improved key management and storage patterns
   - Enhanced transaction signing security

3. **Network Communication Security**:
   - Updated network-related dependencies to latest secure versions
   - Added additional verification for peer communication

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Dependabot alerts and PRs continuously
2. Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
3. Conduct regular security reviews of codebase
