# Anya Organization

## Building the Future of Bitcoin Smart Contracts

Anya is a suite of Bitcoin technologies focused on implementing Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) and Web5 integration while maintaining Bitcoin's core principles of decentralization, privacy, and security.

## Our Projects

### Core Technologies

- [**Anya-core**](https://github.com/Anya-org/Anya-core) - The foundation of the Anya ecosystem, providing core Bitcoin functionality
- [**dlc-oracle-test**](https://github.com/Anya-org/dlc-oracle-test) - Oracle implementation for Discrete Log Contracts
- [**dlc-standalone-test**](https://github.com/Anya-org/dlc-standalone-test) - Standalone implementation of DLC contracts for testing
- [**dlc-test-app**](https://github.com/Anya-org/dlc-test-app) - Example application demonstrating DLC usage

### Our Approach

We adhere to core Bitcoin principles:
- Maintain decentralization, security, and immutability in all operations
- Ensure transparency and clarity in all transactions
- Implement DLCs that are private and don't bloat the blockchain
- Support Web5 integration for decentralized identity
