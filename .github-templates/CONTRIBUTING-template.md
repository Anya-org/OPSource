   - Preserve user privacy in all implementations

3. **Code Quality**
   - Write maintainable, well-documented code
   - Include comprehensive tests

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Create a fork of the repository you want to contribute to

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   - Create a branch with a descriptive name
   - Use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, etc.

3. **Develop and Test**
   - Write code following our code style guidelines
   - Include tests that cover your changes
   - Ensure all existing tests pass

4. **Pull Request**
   - Create a pull request to the main branch
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any related issues

## Coding Standards

- Follow Rust style guidelines and use `rustfmt`
- Use `clippy` to catch common issues
