# Branching Strategy for Python to Rust Migration

## Core Principles

1. **Operational Stability**: The `main` branch must always contain working components only
2. **Parallel Implementation**: Maintain Python implementation until Rust replacement is fully tested
3. **Feature Isolation**: Each Rust component migrates in its own feature branch
4. **Incremental Integration**: Merge completed components individually rather than all at once

## Branch Structure

```
main (stable/operational)
├── develop (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/rust-bitcoin-core
│   ├── feature/rust-wallet-bdk
│   ├── feature/rust-lightning-ldk
│   └── feature/rust-dlc
└── release/v1.x.x (current production version)
```

## Workflow

1. **Development Phase**:
   - Create a feature branch for each Bitcoin component from `develop`
   - Implement Rust version alongside existing Python code
   - Add compatibility layer/adapter where needed
   - Complete unit and integration tests

2. **Testing Phase**:
   - Merge feature branch to `develop` when passing all tests
   - Run integration tests on `develop` with combined components
   - Verify operational status of entire system

3. **Release Phase**:
   - Create release branch when a set of features is ready
   - Perform final testing on release branch
   - Merge to `main` when fully operational
   - Tag with appropriate version number

## Version Management

- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
- **Major Version**: Increment for API-breaking changes (e.g., complete Rust migration)
- **Minor Version**: Increment for component migrations (e.g., Rust Bitcoin Core)
- **Patch Version**: Bug fixes and non-breaking improvements

## Testing Requirements

Each migration component must pass:

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-specific functionality tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Inter-component operation tests
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against Python implementation
4. **Operational Tests**: End-to-end system functionality tests

## Parallel Operation

During migration, maintain dual implementations:

```rust
// Example of conditional implementation
#[cfg(feature = "use-rust-bitcoin")]
pub fn get_bitcoin_implementation() -> Box<dyn BitcoinInterface> {
    Box::new(RustBitcoinImplementation::new())
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "use-rust-bitcoin"))]
pub fn get_bitcoin_implementation() -> Box<dyn BitcoinInterface> {
    Box::new(PythonBitcoinImplementation::new())
}
```

## Migration Sequence

Recommended order of migration:

1. Core Bitcoin data structures (`rust-bitcoin`)
2. Wallet operations (`bdk`)
3. Transaction handling and script execution
4. Network layer operations
5. Lightning Network implementation (`ldk`)
6. DLC and advanced features

## Rollback Strategy

In case of operational issues:

1. Immediately revert to Python implementation by disabling Rust feature flag
2. Document specific failure points
3. Fix issues in feature branch
4. Retest thoroughly before attempting reintegration

## Documentation Requirements

Each migrated component requires:

1. Updated API documentation
2. Migration notes for dependent components
3. Performance comparison metrics
4. Known limitations or differences from Python implementation
