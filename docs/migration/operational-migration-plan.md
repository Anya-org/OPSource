# Operational Migration Plan: Python to Rust

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current)
- [x] Evaluate Rust Bitcoin libraries and capabilities
- [x] Create example implementations (`rust-bitcoin-example.rs`, `bdk-wallet-example.rs`)
- [x] Update system documentation to reflect migration plans
- [ ] Create feature flags in build system to toggle between implementations
- [ ] Develop common interface layer for both Python and Rust implementations

### Phase 2: Core Bitcoin Migration
- [ ] Setup parallel implementation of Bitcoin Core functionality
  - [ ] Start with non-critical read-only operations
  - [ ] Maintain Python implementation as fallback
  - [ ] Add comprehensive test suite comparing outputs of both implementations
- [ ] Implementation strategy:
  ```rust
  // Feature flag controlled implementation selection
  #[cfg(feature = "use-rust-bitcoin")]
  pub mod bitcoin_impl {
      use bitcoin::*;
      // Rust implementation
  }
  
  #[cfg(not(feature = "use-rust-bitcoin"))]
  pub mod bitcoin_impl {
      use python_bitcoinlib_adapter::*;
      // Python implementation via FFI
  }
  ```

### Phase 3: Wallet Operations Migration
- [ ] Implement BDK-based wallet operations alongside existing solution
- [ ] Create compatibility layer for wallet state migration
- [ ] Implement key management transition strategy
- [ ] Testing focus:
  - [ ] Transaction signing correctness
  - [ ] Key derivation validation
  - [ ] Address generation verification

### Phase 4: Lightning & Advanced Features
- [ ] Integrate LDK for Lightning operations
- [ ] Implement DLC functionality with Rust
- [ ] Connect with existing systems via adapter pattern

## Operational Stability Measures

### Feature Flags System
```toml
# In Cargo.toml
[features]
default = ["python-bitcoin"]
python-bitcoin = ["dep:python_bitcoinlib_adapter"]
rust-bitcoin = ["dep:bitcoin", "dep:bdk"]
```

### Dual Runtime Support
Maintain both implementations with runtime toggling for quick fallback:

```rust
pub enum BitcoinImplementation {
    Python,
    Rust
}

pub fn set_bitcoin_implementation(impl_type: BitcoinImplementation) {
    // Store in app configuration
}

pub fn get_transaction_by_id(txid: &str) -> Result<Transaction, BitcoinError> {
    if config::uses_rust_implementation() {
        // Call Rust implementation
        rust_bitcoin::get_transaction(txid)
    } else {
        // Call Python implementation
        python_bitcoin::get_transaction(txid)
    }
}
```

### Testing Requirements
1. **Parallel Validation**: Run operations against both implementations and compare results
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Focus on edge cases and Bitcoin protocol specifics
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Document throughput differences between implementations

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Shadow Mode**: Run Rust implementation alongside Python in production but only log results
2. **Percentage Rollout**: Gradually increase traffic to Rust implementation (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
3. **Component-wise Migration**: Migrate one functional area at a time rather than the entire system

## Operational Readiness Checklist

Before migrating each component to Rust, ensure:

- [ ] 100% feature parity with Python implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and property-based tests)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show equivalent or better results
- [ ] Documented fallback procedure for critical issues
- [ ] Monitoring in place for implementation-specific metrics
- [ ] Training for development team on Rust-specific debugging and maintenance

## Rollback Procedures

1. **Per-Component Rollback**: Each component can be individually reverted to Python
2. **Emergency Procedure**: Single configuration change to disable all Rust implementations
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensure wallet and transaction state remains consistent across rollbacks

## Migration Schedule Considerations

- Prioritize non-critical components first
- Schedule migrations during low-activity periods
- Allow sufficient buffer time between component migrations
- Implement thorough testing period before each production deployment

## Documentation Updates

During migration, maintain dual documentation for both implementations until migration is complete. Update all of the following:

1. API references
2. Integration guides
3. Troubleshooting procedures
4. Development environment setup
