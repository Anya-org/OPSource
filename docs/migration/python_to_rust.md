# Python to Rust Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the process for migrating from the Python Bitcoin implementation (python-bitcoinlib) to the Rust Bitcoin implementation (rust-bitcoin, BDK). The migration is being performed in phases to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing functionality.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current)

- [x] Evaluate Rust Bitcoin libraries and capabilities
- [x] Create example implementations
- [x] Update system documentation to reflect migration plans
- [x] Create feature flags in build system to toggle between implementations
- [x] Develop common interface layer for both Python and Rust implementations
- [x] Implement shadow mode for comparing implementations
- [x] Create tools for analyzing comparison results

### Phase 2: Core Bitcoin Migration

- [ ] Setup parallel implementation of Bitcoin Core functionality
  - [ ] Start with non-critical read-only operations
  - [ ] Maintain Python implementation as fallback
  - [ ] Add comprehensive test suite comparing outputs of both implementations
- [ ] Implement wallet operations with BDK
- [ ] Implement transaction handling with rust-bitcoin
- [ ] Implement network operations with rust-bitcoin

### Phase 3: Lightning & Advanced Features

- [ ] Integrate LDK for Lightning operations
- [ ] Implement DLC functionality with Rust
- [ ] Connect with existing systems via adapter pattern

## Implementation Strategy

The migration is being implemented using a common interface layer that abstracts away the underlying implementation details. This allows for a gradual transition from Python to Rust without disrupting existing functionality.

### Common Interface

The `BitcoinInterface` trait defines the common interface for both implementations:

```rust
pub trait BitcoinInterface: Send + Sync {
    fn get_transaction(&self, txid: &str) -> BitcoinResult<BitcoinTransaction>;
    fn get_block(&self, hash: &str) -> BitcoinResult<Vec<BitcoinTransaction>>;
    fn get_block_height(&self) -> BitcoinResult<u32>;
    fn generate_address(&self, address_type: AddressType) -> BitcoinResult<BitcoinAddress>;
    fn create_transaction(&self, outputs: Vec<(String, u64)>, fee_rate: u64) -> BitcoinResult<BitcoinTransaction>;
    fn broadcast_transaction(&self, transaction: &BitcoinTransaction) -> BitcoinResult<String>;
    fn get_balance(&self) -> BitcoinResult<u64>;
    fn estimate_fee(&self, target_blocks: u8) -> BitcoinResult<u64>;
    fn implementation_type(&self) -> BitcoinImplementationType;
}
```

### Feature Flags

The build system uses feature flags to control which implementations are available:

```toml
[features]
default = ["rust-bitcoin"]
python-bitcoin = ["pyo3"]
rust-bitcoin = ["bitcoin", "bdk", "bitcoincore-rpc"]
full = ["python-bitcoin", "rust-bitcoin"]
```

### Shadow Mode

Shadow mode allows running both implementations side by side and comparing the results. This is useful for validating the Rust implementation against the Python implementation.

To run in shadow mode:

```bash
# PowerShell
$env:SHADOW_MODE = "true"
$env:PRIMARY_IMPL = "python"  # or "rust"
$env:LOG_FILE = "logs/shadow_comparison.log"
cargo run -- test

# Bash
SHADOW_MODE=true PRIMARY_IMPL=python LOG_FILE=logs/shadow_comparison.log cargo run -- test
```

## Testing

Comprehensive testing is essential for ensuring a smooth migration. The following testing strategies are being employed:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing the interaction between components
3. **Shadow Mode Testing**: Running both implementations side by side and comparing results
4. **Manual Testing**: Manual verification of functionality

## Rollback Procedure

In case of issues with the Rust implementation, the system can be rolled back to the Python implementation by setting the `USE_RUST_BITCOIN` environment variable to `false` or by using the `python` command-line argument:

```bash
# Environment variable
$env:USE_RUST_BITCOIN = "false"
cargo run

# Command-line argument
cargo run -- python
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

During the migration, the following metrics are being monitored:

1. **Compatibility**: Percentage of operations that produce the same results in both implementations
2. **Performance**: Execution time for various operations
3. **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption of both implementations
4. **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of errors encountered
