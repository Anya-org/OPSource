## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Rust style guide
- Use type hints in Python
- Document all public APIs
- Write comprehensive tests

### Safety Requirements
1. **Memory Safety**
   - No unsafe blocks without review
   - Memory leak detection
   - Bounds checking

2. **Thread Safety**
   - Lock-free where possible
   - Deadlock detection
   - Race condition analysis

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error types
   - No unwrap without justification
   - Proper error propagation

### Performance Requirements
1. **Latency**
   - < 10ms for critical paths
   - < 100ms for full pipeline
   - Async I/O for blocking operations

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory: < 2GB per instance
   - CPU: < 80% utilization
   - GPU: Efficient sharing

3. **Scalability**
