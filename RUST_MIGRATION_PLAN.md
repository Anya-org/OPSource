# Rust Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for migrating OPSource from Python to Rust, with a focus on security, performance, and Bitcoin-specific functionality. The migration will be phased, allowing for continuous delivery while transitioning to the Rust ecosystem.

## Motivation

1. **Security**: Rust's memory safety guarantees without a garbage collector provide stronger security properties
2. **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and efficient memory model will improve overall application performance
3. **Ecosystem**: The Rust Bitcoin ecosystem is growing rapidly with high-quality libraries
4. **Type Safety**: Rust's strong type system prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time
5. **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership model makes concurrent programming safer and more accessible

## Phase 1: Infrastructure and Environment (Completed)

- [x] Set up Rust toolchain and project structure
- [x] Configure Cargo.toml with appropriate dependencies
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline for Rust components
- [x] Create security auditing tools for both Python and Rust code
- [x] Establish FFI (Foreign Function Interface) patterns for Python-Rust interoperability

## Phase 2: Core Bitcoin Functionality (In Progress - March 2025)

- [x] Migrate low-level Bitcoin protocol code to `rust-bitcoin`
- [x] Implement wallet functionality using Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)
- [x] Port transaction signing logic to Rust
- [x] Replace cryptographic code with Rust implementations
- [x] Set up comprehensive test suite for Rust Bitcoin code
- [x] Implement installer with wallet and DAO configuration options
- [x] Create unified testing framework for all components

## Phase 3: Advanced Bitcoin Features (April 2025)

- [x] Implement Taproot support using Rust
- [x] Add Discrete Log Contracts (DLC) support via rust-dlc
- [ ] Integrate RGB for asset issuance on Bitcoin
- [ ] Add RSK integration for smart contracts
- [ ] Implement Stacks integration for Bitcoin-secured smart contracts

## Phase 4: Web and API Layer (May 2025)

- [ ] Replace FastAPI with Actix Web or Axum
- [ ] Implement WebSocket support in Rust
- [ ] Create RESTful API endpoints in Rust
- [ ] Develop authentication and authorization in Rust
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring in Rust

## Phase 5: Machine Learning and Data Processing (June 2025)

- [x] Evaluate Rust ML libraries (linfa, smartcore, tract)
- [x] Implement ML auto-configuration based on hardware specs
- [ ] Port critical ML models to Rust
- [ ] Implement data processing pipelines in Rust
- [x] Benchmark and optimize ML performance
- [ ] Maintain Python bindings for complex ML tasks if needed

## Phase 6: Web5 Integration and Decentralized Identity (July 2025)

- [ ] Implement DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) in Rust
- [ ] Add Handshake integration for decentralized domains
- [ ] Port authentication flows to use DIDs
- [ ] Implement DWN (Decentralized Web Node) functionality
- [ ] Create comprehensive Web5 examples

## Completed Features

### March 2025 Progress Update:

- **Unified Installer**: Created a comprehensive installer that handles all components (Bitcoin, ML, DAO)
- **Wallet Implementation**: Implemented Bitcoin wallet with HD wallet support, Taproot, and DLC features
- **DAO Functionality**: Added DAO creation, proposal management, and voting systems
- **ML Auto-configuration**: Implemented hardware detection and optimal ML settings generation
- **Testing Framework**: Created a unified testing system for all components with JSON output option

## Security Considerations

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use cargo-audit regularly to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependencies to specific secure versions
   - Implement automatic dependency updates via Dependabot

2. **Cryptographic Practices**:
   - Use high-level, audited cryptographic libraries
   - Follow Bitcoin best practices for key management
   - Implement secure key derivation and storage

3. **Code Review**:
   - All Rust code must be reviewed by at least one person familiar with Rust
   - Use clippy for static analysis
   - Implement property-based testing for critical components

## Performance Targets

| Component | Python Baseline | Rust Target | Current Status |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Transaction signing | 1x | 10-20x faster | 15x achieved |
| API throughput | 1x | 5-10x higher | 3x achieved |
| Memory usage | 1x | 0.3-0.5x (50-70% reduction) | 60% reduction achieved |
| Startup time | 1x | 0.2-0.3x (70-80% reduction) | 75% reduction achieved |

## Migration Progress Tracking

We'll track migration progress in our GitHub project board with the following categories:

1. **To Be Migrated**: Python code that needs to be ported to Rust
