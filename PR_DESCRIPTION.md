# Implement Web5 Agent with "Read First Always" Principle

## Summary
This PR adds a comprehensive implementation of Web5 and Federated Learning agents to the Anya-Core framework. The agents follow the "read first always" principle and break down complex tasks into manageable chunks for efficient processing.

## Features Added
- **Web5 Agent**: Implements DID resolution, credential verification, and secure messaging
- **Federated Learning Agent**: Privacy-preserving ML with differential privacy guarantees
- **System Map**: Global state tracking and relationship management between components
- **Core Agent Framework**: Shared traits and interfaces for all ML agents
- **Utility Scripts**: Branch management, PR creation, and cleanup tools

## Architectural Decisions
- All agents follow the "read first always" principle, ensuring they read the system state before taking actions
- Complex operations are broken into manageable chunks for better error handling and resource management
- Privacy, security, and decentralization principles are maintained throughout the implementation

## Testing
- Added test structure for all agent implementations
- Implemented test cases for DID resolution, credential verification, and message processing

## Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation for integrating ML agents with Stacks and DAO components
- Included inline documentation explaining the design principles and implementation details

## Security Considerations
- Enforced strict credential verification protocols
- Implemented privacy budgeting for federated learning
- Ensured proper error handling and validation for all input data
