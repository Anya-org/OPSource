# Bitcoin Implementation Notes

## OPSource and Anya-core Integration

This repository (OPSource) integrates with Anya-core for Bitcoin functionality. The Anya-core repository contains the following Bitcoin-related components:

- Bitcoin core implementation with Rust
- DLC (Discreet Log Contracts) implementation
- Taproot asset support
- Lightning Network integration

## Architecture

The Bitcoin implementation follows a hexagonal architecture with:

1. Core domain interfaces
2. Rust implementation using rust-bitcoin and BDK
3. Adapter modules for consistent API
4. Configuration management
5. Comprehensive testing framework

## Implementation Strategy

The project will focus exclusively on Rust implementation:

1. **Current Phase**: Complete Rust implementation
2. **Next Phase**: Performance optimization and feature enhancement
3. **Future Phase**: Advanced Bitcoin features (Lightning, Taproot assets)

## Benefits of Rust-only Approach

1. **Performance**: Native performance with minimal overhead
2. **Safety**: Memory safety without garbage collection
3. **Concurrency**: Fearless concurrency with Rust's ownership model
4. **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of Bitcoin libraries (rust-bitcoin, BDK, LDK)
5. **Consistency**: Single codebase for easier maintenance

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite that ensures the implementation behaves correctly across all supported platforms.
