### Performance Improvements
- 4-6x faster operation for key Bitcoin operations
- ~60% reduction in memory usage
- Improved security through Rust's memory safety guarantees

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive migration guide
- Added detailed migration status document
- Created verification report with performance comparisons
