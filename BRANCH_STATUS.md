# Branch and PR Status Report

## Current Branch Status

### Active Branches
- **main** - Primary development branch, up to date with 'origin/main'
- **fix/security-vulnerabilities** - Contains the Rust migration work, 22 commits ahead of main

### Remote Branches
The following remote branches exist:
- **origin/main** - Main branch on origin
- **origin/fix/security-vulnerabilities** - Rust migration branch on origin
- **origin/gh-pages** - Documentation pages branch
- Multiple branches in anya-core remote (may be obsolete)

## Pull Request Status
- A PR needs to be created to merge `fix/security-vulnerabilities` into `main`
- The PR will complete the Python to Rust migration work

## Stashed Changes
There are 4 stashes in the repository:

1. **stash@{0}**: WIP on fix/security-vulnerabilities
   - Contains updates to `.gitmodules` with organization name changes
   - Updates to README.md with correct repository URLs
   - Removes mobile-related files that might have been moved elsewhere

2. **stash@{1}**: On feature/update-docs (Auto-stash before branch management)
   - Documentation updates (exact content needs verification)

3. **stash@{2}**: WIP on main (Merge branch 'dependabot/pip/sqlalchemy-2.0.38')
   - Related to dependency updates

4. **stash@{3}**: On dependabot/pip/sqlalchemy-2.0.38 (Auto stash before rebase)
   - Related to dependency updates

### Managing Stashes
I've created a PowerShell script to help you manage these stashes safely:

```powershell
.\scripts\stash_manager.ps1
```

This interactive script will allow you to:
1. List all stashes
2. Apply a stash to a temporary branch for safe review
3. Show stash contents
4. Drop stashes when no longer needed

**Note**: The stash@{0} appears to contain important organization name updates that you might want to incorporate into the main branch.

## Cleanup Plan

### Step 1: Create PR
Run the `scripts/create_pr.ps1` script to open a browser window with a pre-filled PR:
```powershell
.\scripts\create_pr.ps1
```

### Step 2: After PR is Merged
Run the `scripts/cleanup_branches.ps1` script to clean up branches:
```powershell
.\scripts\cleanup_branches.ps1
```

### Step 3: Review Stashes
Review and apply or drop stashed changes as needed:
```powershell
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{N}  # To apply a stash
git stash drop stash@{N}   # To drop a stash
```

## Recommendations
1. Complete the PR process to merge the Rust migration
2. Clean up branches and stashes to maintain a tidy repository
3. Consider archiving obsolete feature branches in the 'anya-core' remote
4. Follow up on the next steps identified in the migration verification report
