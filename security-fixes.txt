# Security Fixes for Common Vulnerabilities

## Potential Critical and High Vulnerabilities

1. cryptography < 44.0.2 may have vulnerabilities - upgrade to 44.0.2 or latest version
2. PyYAML < 6.0.3 has known security issues - upgrade to 6.0.3 or latest version
3. tensorflow < 2.18.1 may have security issues - upgrade to 2.18.1 or latest version
4. pycryptodome < 3.21.1 may have security issues - upgrade to 3.21.1 or latest version
5. requests/urllib3 package chain - keep updated to latest compatible versions

## Security Best Practices

1. Always pin dependencies to specific versions
2. Regularly update dependencies with security patches
3. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
4. Scan code for security vulnerabilities regularly
5. Monitor Dependabot alerts and merge security PRs quickly
6. Run the security_audit.ps1 script regularly to check for potential issues

## How to Apply Security Fixes

For immediate security issues, run:

```bash
pip install -U cryptography==44.0.2
pip install -U pycryptodome==3.21.1
pip install -U PyYAML==6.0.3
pip install -U tensorflow==2.18.1
```

For a complete security update:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Monitor Dependabot alerts and pull requests in GitHub to address security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
