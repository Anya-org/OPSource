# Security Fixes for Common Vulnerabilities

## Potential Critical and High Vulnerabilities

1. cryptography < 44.0.2 may have vulnerabilities - upgrade to 44.0.2 or latest version
2. PyYAML < 6.0.2 has known security issues - currently using latest but check for newer versions
3. tensorflow and related packages may have security issues - check for CVEs and update as needed
4. requests/urllib3 package chain - keep updated to latest compatible versions
5. pycryptodome may have security issues - ensure using latest version

## Security Best Practices

1. Always pin dependencies to specific versions
2. Regularly update dependencies with security patches
3. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
4. Scan code for security vulnerabilities regularly
5. Monitor Dependabot alerts and merge security PRs quickly

## How to Apply Security Fixes

For immediate security issues, run:

```bash
pip install -U cryptography==44.0.2
pip install -U pycryptodome==3.21.0
```

For a complete security update:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Monitor Dependabot alerts and pull requests in GitHub to address security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
