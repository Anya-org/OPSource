# Clarinet SDK

The Clarinet SDK can be used to interact with the simnet from Node.js.

You can use this SDK to:
- call public and read-only functions from smart contracts
- get clarity maps or data-var values
- deploy contracts
- get contract ABI
- write unit tests for Clarity smart contracts

## Core

```
npm install @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk
```

### Usage

```ts
import { initVM } from "clarinet-sdk";
import { Cl } from "@stacks/transactions";

async function main() {
  const vm = await initVM();

  const accounts = vm.getAccounts();
  const w1 = accounts.get("wallet_1")!;

  const call = vm.callPublicFn("counter", "add", [Cl.uint(1)], w1);
  console.log(call.result); // Cl.int(Cl.ok(true))

  const counter = vm.getDataVar("counter", "counter");
  console.log(counter); // Cl.int(2)
}

main();
```

By default, the SDK will look for a Clarinet.toml file in the current working directory.
It's also possible to provide the path to the manifest like so:
```ts
 const vm = await initVM("./path/to/Clarinet.toml");
```

## Tests

> Note: A bit of boilerplate is needed to setup the testing environment. Soon it will be handled by the clarinet-cli.

The SDK can be used to write unit-tests for Clarinet projects.  

Let's go to to an existing project or create a new

<details>
  <summary>I'm setting up a new project</summary>

  ```sh
  cd ./my-project
  ls # here you should see the Clarinet.toml file
  npx @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk@latest
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I want to use the SDK in an existing project</summary>
  
  ```sh
  clarinet new my-project # change my-project to whatever you want
  cd ./my-project
  npx @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk@latest
  ```

</details>

The NPM script that was executed should ask you to run `npm install`, press enter to run it.


### Type checking

We recommend to use TypeScript to write the unit tests, but it's also possible to do it with JavaScript. To do so, rename your test files to `.test.js` instead of `.test.ts`. You can also delete the `tsconfig.json` and uninstall typescript with `npm uninstall typescript`. 

Note: If you want to write your test in JavaScript but still have a certain level of type safety and autocompletion, VSCode can help you with that. You can create a basic `jsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "checkJs": true,
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["node_modules/@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk/vitest-helpers/src", "unit-tests"]
}
```

## Contributing

Clone the clarinet repo and go to the clarinet-sdk component directory:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:hirosystems/clarinet.git
cd clarinet/components/clarinet-sdk
```

Open the SDK workspace in VSCode:
```sh
code ./clarinet-sdk.code-workspace
```

Compile the project (both WASM and JS):
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
